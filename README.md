# carolpack
My very own modpack for Minecraft that is just a bunch of compiled mods.
If you have an Nvidia GPU, you can use the modpack labelled **carolpack-<version>-Nvidia**.
However, if you do not have an Nvidia GPU, you may use the modpack labelled **carolpack-<version>-NoNvidia**.

All credits for the mods and whatnot go to their respective authors.

Latest Version: 1.20.2

I will probably update it to 1.21.0 when that releases sometime this year!!

List of mods:
TBA I'll add this later
