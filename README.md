# carolpack library
Sets of my mod packs for Minecraft are just a bunch of compiled mods.

#carolpack Vanilla/Unmodded - ~50MB
You can use the modpack labelled **carolpack-<version>-Nvidia** if you have an Nvidia GPU.
However, if you do not have an Nvidia GPU, you may use the modpack labelled **carolpack-<version>-NoNvidia**.

#carolpack - Modded Server - ~1.8GB
You probably shouldn't use this unless you're also part of the MineColonies server run by Lumpoon. 

All credits for the mods and whatnot go to their respective authors.

Latest Version: 1.20.2

I will probably update it to 1.21.0 when that releases sometime this year!!

List of mods:
TBA I'll add this later
